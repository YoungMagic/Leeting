A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

public:
    int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int A = m + n - 2, B = min(m - 1, n - 1);
        long long result = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= B; i++)
            result = result * A-- / i;
        return static_cast<int>(result);
    }
};
