You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Note: Given n will be a positive integer.
//a代表达到当前位置需要的步数，b代表达到下一位置需要的步数，更新

class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        int a = 1, b = 1;
        while (n--)
            a = (b += a) - a;
        return a;
    }
};
